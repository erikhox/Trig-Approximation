This program was made due to my curiosity after looking at the taylor series through desmos. I wanted to code it myself a way to intepret the taylor series os sine, cosine, and tangent. I also wanted to use my own in-house functions for power and factorial even though their is for example <cmath>, just for the fun.

The way it works is that the program will first ask for a number you wish to approximate in radians. Then it will ask for the level of precision, this is the 'n' in the sumation of the taylor series, for anything with -pi to pi, 7 works perfectly.

It will then output the 3 approxomations of sine, cosine, and tangent using the functions I made.
